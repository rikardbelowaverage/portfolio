# Rikard's Portfolio
Here I'd like to share a brief summary of my portfolio

#Project 1 : Data analysis, New York. Project overview
#Created a project where data is first collected. Then using geopy to convert adresses to coordinates.
#Then collecting venue-data from Foursquare. Once data is collected we can run k-means clustering
